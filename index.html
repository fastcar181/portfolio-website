        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Grace Le, and I'm currently a second-year computer science student at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario! This website is going to showcase all my notable projects. It's currently in its early stages, so I look forward to continuously updating it throughout the semester by adding more projects and updating the UI!</p>

        <h2>Project #1: Portfolio Website</h2>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
        <p>Software and tools: Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code</p>
        <p>I started off this website with basic HTML, slowly adding CSS and JavaScript to give the portfolio a nicer UI.</p>
        <h3>Highlights:</h3>
        <p>Git: I used Git to help me develop this website on my laptop and desktop computer.</p>
        <h3>Challenges:</h3>
        <p>Carousel: Developing the image carousel seen under Project #2 was difficult, but I searched all over the internet to help me develop a solution that worked.</p>

        <h2>Project #2: Robot Delivery Program</h2>
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Languages: Java</p>
        <p>Software and tools: Webots</p>
        <p>This was a final team project for an introduction to robotics course (COMP 2801). The purpose of this program was to implement a search algorithm and collision-free movement that would allow the robot to collect green jars and deliver them to the dropoff location, stopping the simulation once two green jars were delivered.</p>
        <h3>Highlights:</h3>
        <p>LiDAR: I implemented a simple LiDAR detection system to help prevent collisions.</p>
        <p>Camera detection: I utilized the built-in Webots camera to help with the process of identifying green jars and the green dropoff location.</p>
        <p>State machines: I planned out state machines for the robot's various states before implementation, ensuring all cases were covered.</p>
        <h3>Challenges:</h3>
        <p>Collisions: To create a reliable collision-free movement, I implemented both distance and LiDAR sensors and recorded the numbers for the sensors to gauge the numbers to use in the program.</p>

        <h2>Project #3: Steam Statistics</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Languages: Python</p>
        <p>Software and tools: Steam API, Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code</p>
        <p>This is a super simple Steam-based program that fetches some info on a specific Steam profile, given a Steam API key and Steam ID. I enjoy playing games, so I wanted to dip my toes into creating a program that involves games in one way or another. I'm excited to expand this particular project by implementing a GUI, allowing for a more user friendly interface!</p>
        <h3>Highlights:</h3>
        <p>API: This was my first time using an API, but I was really hooked when I first got it working by fetching my Steam profile's display name. This caused me to read the Steam API documentation and have a little fun playing around with this API.</p>
        <h3>Challenges:</h3>
        <p>API: Since I'm new to APIs, I was a little confused, but I quickly got the hang of it by simply conducting research (watching videos, reading documentation, etc.).</p>
